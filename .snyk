          Currently at version 2.1.2. Snyk recommends upgrading to 3.0.0, however:
          Version 3.0.0 does not appear to be available yet on PyPI
          The latest langgraph (1.0.1) depends on langgraph-checkpoint 2.1.2
          This appears to be a future recommendation or may reflect packages not yet released
